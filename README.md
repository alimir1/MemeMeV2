## Introduction

I created this app for a [course](https://www.udacity.com/course/uikit-fundamentals--ud788) on Udacity iOS Developer Nanodegree.

* Create a meme from selecting or taking a photo
* Add text to the top and bottom
* Share and Save Meme to friends on Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, etc.
* View saved Memes in a grid or a list.
* View a saved Meme
